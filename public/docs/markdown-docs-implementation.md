# Markdown Documentation Implementation

This document explains how markdown files in the docs directory are served as pages within the website template.

## Overview

To make the documentation more accessible, markdown files in the docs directory are now served as pages within the website template. A new "Docs" dropdown menu has been added to the navigation bar, allowing users to easily access the documentation.

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **MarkdownViewer Component**:
   - A reusable component that renders markdown content
   - Uses the markdown-it library to parse and render markdown
   - Includes styling for various markdown elements
   - Supports dark mode

2. **DocViewer Component**:
   - A view component that displays a single documentation page
   - Uses the MarkdownViewer component to render the markdown content
   - Extracts the document name from the route parameters
   - Handles loading states and errors
   - Sets the document title based on the document name

3. **DocsList Component**:
   - A view component that lists all available documentation pages
   - Displays a grid of cards, each linking to a specific documentation page
   - Includes a title and description for each document

### Routing

Two new routes have been added to the router:

1. `/docs` - Displays the DocsList component, which lists all available documentation pages
2. `/docs/:docName` - Displays the DocViewer component, which renders a specific documentation page

### Navigation

A dropdown menu has been added to the navigation bar:

1. The "Docs" item has been added next to the "About" item
2. When hovering over the "Docs" item, a dropdown menu appears with links to the most important documentation pages
3. A "View All Docs" link at the bottom of the dropdown menu takes the user to the docs index page

### File Access

To make the markdown files accessible via HTTP requests:

1. A script has been added to copy the markdown files from the docs directory to the public/docs directory
2. The script runs during both development and build processes
3. The MarkdownViewer component loads the markdown files from the public/docs directory

## Usage

To view the documentation:

1. Click on the "Docs" item in the navigation bar
2. Select a specific documentation page from the dropdown menu, or click "View All Docs" to see all available pages
3. Browse through the documentation pages

## Benefits

This implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Accessibility**: Documentation is now easily accessible from the website
2. **Consistent Experience**: Documentation is displayed within the website template, providing a consistent user experience
3. **Better Organization**: Documentation is organized in a structured way, making it easier to find specific information
4. **Enhanced Readability**: Markdown content is styled to match the website's design, improving readability
5. **Dark Mode Support**: Documentation pages support dark mode, providing a better experience for users who prefer dark themes

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Search Functionality**: Add a search feature to help users find specific information in the documentation
2. **Table of Contents**: Add a table of contents for each documentation page
3. **Related Documents**: Show related documents at the bottom of each page
4. **Version Control**: Add version information to documentation pages
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide feedback on documentation pages
