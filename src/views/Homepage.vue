      <p>
        Throughout my career, I've consistently achieved significant impacts on process improvement, project success, and team motivation. I adhere to a philosophy of servant leadership, where I put my team's needs at the forefront, facilitating their professional development, encouraging innovative thinking, and nurturing a positive and productive work environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an engineering manager, my focus isn't just on technical aspects. I strive to bridge the gap between IT and the rest of the business, communicating effectively to ensure seamless collaboration and mutual understanding. I am an ardent follower of tech trends and have expertise in back-end systems development along with a multitude of other programming skills. My passion for continuous learning doesn't stop at me, I encourage and support my team's pursuit of knowledge as well.

        I can also do a Rubiks cube super fast. That's cool, right?
