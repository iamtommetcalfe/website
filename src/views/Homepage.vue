        My name is Tom Stirrop-Metcalfe, a passionate and committed engineering leader. With over 15
        years of experience in PHP programming and 10+ years leading teams, I am always ready to
        take on challenging and exciting projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I've consistently achieved significant impacts on process improvement,
        project success, and team motivation. I adhere to a philosophy of servant leadership, where
        I put my team's needs at the forefront, facilitating their professional development,
        encouraging innovative thinking, and nurturing a positive and productive work environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an engineering manager, my focus isn't just on technical aspects. I strive to bridge the
        gap between IT and the rest of the business, communicating effectively to ensure seamless
        collaboration and mutual understanding. I am an ardent follower of tech trends and have
        expertise in back-end systems development along with a multitude of other programming
        skills. My passion for continuous learning doesn't stop at me, I encourage and support my
        team's pursuit of knowledge as well.
      </p>
      <p>I can also do a Rubiks cube super fast. That's cool, right?</p>
