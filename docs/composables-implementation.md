# Composable Functions Implementation

This document explains the implementation of composable functions in the project, which was completed as part of task #6 in the improvement tasks list.

## Overview

Composable functions are a key feature of Vue 3's Composition API that allow for better code organization, reusability, and maintainability. They extract and encapsulate reusable stateful logic from components, making it easier to share functionality across the application.

## Implemented Composables

### 1. useTheme

The `useTheme` composable manages the application's theme (dark/light mode) and replaces the previous Vuex-based implementation.

**Features:**

- Persists theme preference in localStorage
- Provides reactive state for the current theme
- Offers functions to toggle or set the theme
- Automatically applies theme classes to the HTML element

**Files changed:**

- Created `src/composables/useTheme.ts`
- Updated `App.vue` to use the composable
- Updated `Header.vue` to use the composable
- Updated `Footer.vue` to use the composable

### 2. useAnalytics

The `useAnalytics` composable provides Google Analytics tracking functionality and replaces the previous plugin-based implementation.

**Features:**

- Lazy loads the Google Analytics script
- Provides functions for tracking page views and events
- Supports automatic page tracking with Vue Router
- Skips tracking in development mode

**Files changed:**

- Created `src/composables/useAnalytics.ts`
- Updated `main.ts` to use the composable
- Removed dependency on the analytics plugin

### 3. useBuildInfo

The `useBuildInfo` composable manages the display of build information in the footer and replaces the previous component-specific implementation.

**Features:**

- Provides reactive state for showing/hiding build info
- Offers functions to toggle visibility and force refresh
- Handles the build timestamp from environment variables

**Files changed:**

- Created `src/composables/useBuildInfo.ts`
- Updated `Footer.vue` to use the composable

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Logic is now centralized in dedicated composable functions rather than spread across components and the Vuex store.

2. **Better Reusability**: The extracted logic can be easily reused in any component without duplication.

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes to core functionality (like theme management) can now be made in a single place.

4. **Type Safety**: All composables are fully typed with TypeScript, providing better developer experience and catching errors at compile time.

5. **Simplified Components**: Components are now more focused on their UI responsibilities, with complex logic moved to composables.

## Documentation

A comprehensive README.md file was created in the composables directory to document:

- What composables are and their benefits
- Available composables and their usage
- Examples of how to use each composable
- Return values and parameters

This documentation will help future developers understand and use the composables effectively.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation covers the core functionality of the application, additional composables could be created for:

1. **Form Handling**: A `useForm` composable for form validation and submission
2. **API Requests**: A `useApi` composable for making API requests with error handling
3. **Pagination**: A `usePagination` composable for handling paginated data
4. **Responsive Design**: A `useBreakpoint` composable for responsive design logic

These could be implemented as part of task #7 (Create a component library with consistent styling and behavior).
