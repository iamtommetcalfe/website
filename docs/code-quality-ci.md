# Automated Code Quality Checks in CI Pipeline

This document explains the implementation of automated code quality checks in the CI pipeline, which was completed as part of task #60 in the improvement tasks list.

## Overview

Automated code quality checks help maintain consistent code style, prevent bugs, and ensure best practices are followed. These checks run automatically in the CI pipeline, preventing code that doesn't meet quality standards from being deployed.

## Implemented Tools

### 1. ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript code.

**Configuration:**

- `.eslintrc.json` contains the ESLint configuration
- Extends recommended configs for JavaScript, Vue 3, and TypeScript
- Custom rules to match project requirements

### 2. Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style.

**Configuration:**

- `.prettierrc.json` contains the Prettier configuration
- Settings for indentation, quotes, semicolons, etc.

### 3. TypeScript Type Checking

TypeScript's type checker helps catch type-related errors before runtime.

**Configuration:**

- Uses existing `tsconfig.json`
- Runs via `vue-tsc --noEmit` command

## CI Pipeline Implementation

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) has been updated to include a new job for code quality checks:

```yaml
code-quality:
  name: Code Quality Checks
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
        cache: 'npm'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Type check
      run: npm run type-check

    - name: Lint
      run: npm run lint

    - name: Check formatting
      run: npx prettier --check src/
```

This job runs before the deployment job and ensures that:

1. TypeScript types are valid
2. ESLint rules are followed
3. Code is properly formatted according to Prettier rules

The deployment job only runs if all code quality checks pass.

## Local Development

Developers can run the same checks locally using the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Check and fix linting issues
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Check TypeScript types
npm run type-check
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Ensures all code follows the same style and best practices
2. **Early Detection**: Catches issues before they reach production
3. **Documentation**: Provides clear rules for code quality
4. **Automation**: Reduces manual review time for style and formatting issues
5. **Confidence**: Builds confidence in the codebase quality

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include:

1. Adding Husky for pre-commit hooks (task #58)
2. Implementing conventional commits (task #59)
3. Adding more specific ESLint rules for the project
4. Implementing test coverage checks
