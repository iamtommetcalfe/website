# Cache Busting Implementation

This document explains the cache busting implementation for the website.

## Overview

To prevent browsers from serving cached older versions of the website, we've implemented several cache busting techniques:

1. **Content Hashing**: All assets (JS, CSS, images) include a hash in their filenames that changes when the content changes.
2. **Build Timestamp**: Each build includes a unique timestamp that forces browsers to fetch the latest version.
3. **Cache Control Headers**: Different cache control strategies are applied to different types of files:
   - HTML and JSON files: `max-age=0, must-revalidate` to ensure they're always fresh
   - Static assets (JS, CSS, images): `max-age=31536000, immutable` for efficient long-term caching
4. **Cache Purging**: The GitHub Actions workflow includes a comprehensive step to purge the cache for multiple URLs when deploying.
5. **Service Worker Updates**: The service worker is configured to immediately activate and take control of all clients when updated.
6. **Version Verification**: A hidden build info indicator in the footer allows users to verify they're seeing the latest version and force a refresh if needed.

## Implementation Details

### Vite Configuration

The Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts` includes:

- Content hashing for all assets with `[name].[hash].[ext]` pattern
- Enhanced PWA configuration with:
  - `cleanupOutdatedCaches: true` to remove outdated caches
  - `skipWaiting: true` to activate new service worker immediately
  - `clientsClaim: true` to take control of all clients
  - Dynamic `cacheId` that includes the build timestamp to force cache invalidation
  - Proper manifest configuration for PWA installation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/main.yml` includes:

- A build timestamp environment variable that changes with each build
- A step to create a version.json file with build information
- A comprehensive cache purging step that:
  - Purges the cache for the main site URL and common routes
  - Purges asset directories
  - Sets appropriate cache control headers for different file types:
    - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for static assets
    - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` for HTML and JSON files

### Application Code

The application code includes:

- A meta tag with the build timestamp in `index.html` to force cache invalidation
- A global property for the build timestamp in `main.ts`
- A hidden build info indicator in the footer that:
  - Displays the build timestamp when clicked
  - Includes a refresh button to force refresh the page, bypassing cache
- A `useBuildInfo` composable that manages build information display and provides the force refresh functionality

## Verifying the Latest Version

Users can verify they're seeing the latest version by:

1. Looking for the small dot in the bottom right corner of the page
2. Clicking on it to display the build timestamp
3. If needed, clicking the refresh button (â†») next to the build timestamp to force a refresh
4. Alternatively, forcing a refresh by pressing Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

The service worker is configured to automatically update when a new version is available, but the refresh button provides a manual option if needed.
